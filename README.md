**Journalism in the Age of Data-notes**

A video report on data visualization as a storytelling medium | Produced during a 2009-2010 Knight Journalism Fellowship | Total Running Time: 54 Minutes; with related information and links.
In media, we can now see the importance of art visualization. Data visualization is evolving into a discipline. 
The story of Amanda, the journalist from the New York Times, is interesting; she studied statistics and then became a data journalist due to an internship in graphics at the New York times. I think her communication skills are amazing. She was able to communicate research through data visualization. She helped the reader find unemployment rates for different people, as the unemployment rates vary for different people. 
People from the BBC is also shown in this video. 
They show the data in the visualization and allow the reader to interpret the data. 
Data visualization mean visualizing a lot of data, and that is given rise to a trend that is damaging because some of them are incomprehensive.- Nigel Homes, Information Graphics Designer 

Chapter 3: Telling the Story
As a medium to tell a story, visualization is particular. It includes interaction (like videogames)
People use after effects, adobe premiere, and more to create the graphics. 
A new generation of designers in data visualization is coming. 
Infographics are dominated by fashion. 
Before, we had narrative illustration graphics and now is more statistic rich graphics.
