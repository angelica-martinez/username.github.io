A video report on data visualization as a storytelling medium | Produced during a 2009-2010 Knight Journalism Fellowship | Total Running Time: 54 Minutes; with related information and links.
In media we can see now the importance of art visualization. Data visualization is evolving into a discipline. 
The story of Amanda the journalist from the New York Times is interesting, she studied stadistics and then became a data journalist due to an internship in graphics at the New York times. I think her communication skills are amazing, she was able to communicate research through data visualization. She helped reader to find unemployment rates for different people, as the uneployment rates varies for different people.
